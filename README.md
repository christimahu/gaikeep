# GAIKeep

## Overview

**GAIKeep** (Generated Artificial Intelligence Keeper) is a companion tool designed to enhance your experience with Large Language Models (LLMs). It aggregates requests, listens for your cue, and keeps the important responses you tag in a local file or database.

### Features

- **Response Aggregation:** Automatically captures and stores responses from various LLM tools.
- **Tagging System:** Mark responses with custom tags for easy retrieval.
- **AI Hallucination Detection:** A future feature to compare responses across different tools to detect and alert on AI-generated inaccuracies.
